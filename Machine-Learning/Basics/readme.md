What is Aritifial Intelligence??
AI is a branch of computer science that is concerned  with  building  smart  and itellegince machines.

What is machine learning??
machine learning is subset of AI.
Deep learning is subset of maachine learning.
machine learning is a technique to implement AI that  can learn  from data by themselves without being explicitly programmed.


what is Deep learning??
deep learning is  a subfield  of machine learning  that uses AI neural networks(algorithm ) to learn from data

type of machine learning 1. supervised learning  2.unsupervised learning 3.reinforcement learning
1.supervised learning ->>maching learning algorithms learns from lablelled dataa.
for example : let's we take several images of apple and mango as a data feeds to machine recognize on
basis of label whether it is similar to compared enitity one or not . 
the data we provided contains features (like color,shape,texture) with correct label

2.Unsupervised learning -->>    machine learning algorithm learns from unlabellled data
for example -> we take random object like diffrent type of fruit  ->> we recognize to make a group
wheter it belong from their group

3.Reinforcemenet learning  --> it is an area of  machine learning concerned with how  intelligent agent take 
action in an environment to maximize its rewards.
role in reinforcement learning
1.Environment 
2.Agent
3.Action
4.Reward
For example : we play chess on computer . we have multiple ai trained model . there environment is chess board
and agent is computer (which decide moves) and give reward (wheter it is positive or negative).
